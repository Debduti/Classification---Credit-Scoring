# Credit-Scoring

## Objective
With this project, our objective is to create a fully compliant PD model to determine good and bad applicants. 

## Approach
My approach to solving this problem can be broadly outlined into the following steps:

1.	Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis. Creation of 3 new variables that capture the pattern in the data better
2.	Calculating Weight of Evidence to perform variable selection
3.	Creating our base model of predicting good and bad applicants using Logistic Regression model and creating the scorecard
4.	Comparing base model with ensemble models like Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost.
5.	Finally creating a two-cut-off point strategy for the scorecard.
